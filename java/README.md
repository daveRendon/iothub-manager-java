Build and Run
=============

The project workflow is managed via Gradle. You can either install it to your system and
invoke `gradle`, or use the `gradlew` wrapper included in the root folder.

### Compile

To compile the project:

```
gradle classes
```

or 

```
gradlew classes
```

### Run

To run the project from the command line:

```
gradle run
```

### Run tests and all checks

```
gradle check
```

### Debug

To debug (or run) from IntelliJ, look for the green "â–¶" icon on the left side of the `Main` class.
